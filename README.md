# projectAI
This is the final porject for the Machine Learning course. The idea was to develop the desktop software using an enterprise language and a Natural Language Processing technique in order to simplify ones life when searching for some movie information.

# 2018 Note
Some API keys are outdated and unfortunately some resources started providing API for funds. Once I find a replacement, I wll think about bringing the project back to life.

# Example usage
Could you please give me an IMDB of the movie Her? Oh, Id like also that kind of information for the movie Jumanji!

~~Some API keys are outdated and unfortunately some resources started providing API for funds. Once I find a replacement, I wll think about bringing the project back to life.~~
Managed to update the API keys!

Remember, it is a university project and it really can provide some unexpected behavior sometimes. For example, I implemented a less strict matching mechanims between the synonyms of some word typed by the user (ie cast) and the synonyms of the keyword required (ie actor), this way app can provide more information (like both release date and imdb) than requested (like only imdb score) or sometimes even find a wrong match (which sometimes happens with cast as a word and plot as a keyword).

# Example usage
Me: Could you please provide an imdb of movie "Her"?  Would be great to know something about "Jumanji".
Robot: Movie "Her" has been released in 10 Jan 2014, imdb score of 8.0.

Could You specify attributes that go with movies: "jumanji"

Me: Lets say, like date of release?
Robot: Movie "Jumanji" has been released in 15 Dec 1995.
